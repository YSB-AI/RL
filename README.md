# Reinforcement Learning challenges

# New development
In this section solutions using tf2 are presented, using new set of thecniques for training agents as well as for the exploration/exploitation tradeoff. 
Async Actor-Critic, Soft Actor-Critic, Proximal-Policy Optimization, Double Deep Q Networks and SARSA are used to train the agents for solving enviroment such as Acrobot, Bipdeal Walker, CartPole, Lunar Lander, Mountain Car, Inverted Pendulum ( ***Still in progress for more enviroments and techniques***).

Greed-Search, Boltzman, Entropy based, Guided AC and Intrinsic Reward are applied here to deal with the exploration-explotation tradeoff

***Projects and detailed information will be updated here soon ***



# Classic development 

This sections contains RL solutions using Tensorflow 1, and a much more limited set of techniques and experience while solving the enviroments.
